minisphere 1.1.8
================

*Tuesday, June 2, 2015*

minisphere is a drop-in replacement for the Sphere game engine written from the
ground up in C.  It boasts high compatibility with most games written for
Sphere 1.x, but with better performance and new functionality.

minisphere is very small, living up to its name: The engine in its entirety
consists of a single executable less than 2MB in size, plus around 200KB or so
for the system assets. This makes it very easy to distribute.


Command Line Options
--------------------

* `--game <path>`: Loads the Sphere game at `<path>`. If not provided,
  minisphere will open a file dialog allowing the user to locate a desired game
  manually. For compatibility reasons, this can also be specified as
  `-game <path>` (with only one dash).

* `--fullscreen`: Starts the engine in full-screen mode.

* `--windowed`: Starts the engine in windowed mode.

* `--frameskip <x>`: Sets the initial frameskip limit to `<x>`. Note that if the
  game calls `SetMaxFrameSkips()`, that value overrides this one.  The default
  frameskip limit is 5.

* `--no-throttle`: Disables interframe throttling. This may improve performance
  on slower machines at the cost of maxing out a processor core.

* `--log-level <0-4>`: Sets the console verbosity. 0 is practically silent,
  while 4 is quite noisy and useful for diagnostics. The default setting is 1.


Potential Compatibility Issues
------------------------------

No mp3 Support
--------------

minisphere is based on Allegro, which doesn't include mp3 support due to
licensing issues. Therefore games using mp3 audio won't run in minisphere unless
the tracks are converted to another format such as Ogg Vorbis (.ogg).

`GrabImage()` and `GrabSurface()`
---------------------------------

These functions create a copy of the contents of the backbuffer and return
either an image or surface from it. In minisphere, however, this may not work as
expected due to the engine's advanced frame skipping algorithm which prevents
anything from being written to the backbuffer during a frameskip.

When writing a game specifically targetting minisphere, the correct solution is
to call `UnskipFrame()`, render what you need, then use
`GrabImage()`/`GrabSurface()` to save the render. If you absolutely *must* grab
a backbuffer image every frame (for advanced rendering effects, etc.), you can
place `SetMaxFrameSkips(0);` at the beginning of your game to prevent any frames
from being skipped.

Note that as a last resort when running older games, you can also pass
`--frameskip 0` to engine.exe on the command line to disable frame skipping.

Interframe Throttling
---------------------

minisphere attempts to minimize its CPU utilization by going to sleep while it
waits for the next frame to start. This improves battery life on laptops and
prevents the engine from heating up the CPU unnecessarily. In most cases this
causes no adverse effects; however on slower computers or more demanding games,
it may cause more frames to be skipped than necessary.

If you want to temporarily disable this feature, run engine.exe with the
`--no-throttle` command line option.

More Aggressive Frame Skipping
------------------------------

minisphere's frame skipping algorithm is very aggressive and many things that
usually happen every frame won't happen if the frame is skipped. For example,
the map engine doesn't call the render script for skipped frames. This can cause
issues if a game does anything other than rendering in a render script and can
be worked around by passing `--frameskip 0` on the command line.

Stricter Type Checking for API Calls
------------------------------------

Sphere 1.x, in general, silently coerces most wrong-type values passed to API
calls. minisphere, however, is a lot stricter about this and will throw an error
if, for example, you pass a string to a function expecting a number value. This
may prevent some poorly-written Sphere games from running under minisphere.
There is currently no workaround other than to edit the scripts by hand.

`const` is a Syntax Error
-------------------------

Duktape, the JavaScript engine that powers minisphere, is fully ES5 compliant
and will throw a syntax error if the `const` keyword is encountered. If you want
to try running the game in minisphere, you will need to manually replace all
instances of `const` in the game's scripts with `var`.
